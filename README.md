# flash_copy_and_tape_robot
A reasonably complex flash copy and backup to tape library 
This is a shell script, notably a korn shell script, which is not much different from bash, I have coded in the bourne, C, korn and bash shells.  
I have included this in the portfolio not only to demonstrate my ability to script but it also shows what my production code looks like ie a lot neater than the code I do for personal consumption. 
I have put copious comments in the script as it was quite a complex operation involving multiple hosts, differnet operating systems, a tape library, a san storage system and flash copying. 
It really did need a lot of explanation, code doesn't usually need this amount of comments but this did. When I wrote it I also produced a document to accompany it with text and graphics to describe the architecture of the solution. 
I have included this to show that I can handle complexity, I can handle dealing wiith multiple technologies, I code neatly, I am not allergic to comments. etc
There was quite a bit of trickery I had to do with LVM too. I have altered it a bit to anonymise it too.
